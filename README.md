# My resume

This is the working repository for my résumé.  The main branch should contain
*all* notable experience, skills, etc. with other (local) branches being used
to trim things down to a single page by removing details not needed for
particular applications.

For a general, one-page resume, see the 'one-page' branch.  This branch should
always contain an up-to-date copy of the resume that fits within a single page
and is applicable to most jobs.

The resume is generated from a JSON file (`resume.json`), resulting in a PDF
and a plaintext version.  This makes it easier to maintain both versions
simultaneously (otherwise they will most certainly get out of sync) and leaves
the door open to using the JSON file in other projects as well (like a
portfolio site).
