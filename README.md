# My résumé

This is the working repository for my résumé.  The main branch should contain
*all* notable experience, skills, etc. with other (local) branches being used
to trim things down to a single page by removing details not needed for
particular applications.  Ideally the PDF file should be kept up to date with
the TeX source, but this might not happen since I tend to forget.

For a general, one-page resume, see the 'one-page' branch.  This branch should
always contain an up-to-date copy of the resume that fits within a single page
and is applicable to most jobs.
