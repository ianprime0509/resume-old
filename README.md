# My résumé

This is the working repository for my résumé. The main branch should
contain *all* notable experience, skills, etc. with other (local)
branches being used to trim things down to a single page by removing
details not needed for particular applications. Ideally the PDF file
should be kept up to date with the TeX source, but this might not
happen since I tend to forget.
